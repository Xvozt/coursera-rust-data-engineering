Several other collection methods also return iterators to yield a sequence of results but avoid allocating an entire collection to store the result in. This provides maximum flexibility as collect or extend can be called to “pipe” the sequence into any collection if desired. Otherwise, the sequence can be looped over with a for loop. The iterator can also be discarded after partial use, preventing the computation of the unused items.
